                <h3>Mentamizh - Tamil Word Processor</h3>
                <p>Our flagship product, Mentamizh, is a state-of-the-art Tamil word processor that
                    meets international standards. In 2013, it received the prestigious &quot;Tamil Nadu Chief
                    Minister Award for Tamil Computing.&quot; The Government of Tamil Nadu has adopted
                    this software for use in its offices across the state.</p>
                
                <h3>MS Office Add-in Tools</h3>
                <p>All the language tools available in our Tamil word processor are also provided as add-
                    in tools for MS Office software, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Publisher.</p>
                
                <h3>Spell Checker</h3>
                <p>Our team has developed a rule-based spell checker for modern written Tamil.
                    Creating this tool required a robust morphological parser to handle Tamil&#39;s agglutinative and
                    inflectional nature. A typical Tamil word-form can contain up to twelve suffixes attached to
                    the root, adhering to strict morphotactic and morphophonological rules. Key components of our development process include: Morphological Parser: Essential for processing Tamil&#39;s complex word
                    formations. Comprehensive Lexicon: Incorporating all necessary details, including noun
                    declensions and verb conjugations. Built on this foundation of Tamil computational morphology, our spell checker effectively
                    identifies errors in Tamil text and provides precise correction suggestions. It also identifies
                    and corrects internal sandhi errors and sandhi between word-forms. This tool maximizes both
                    recall and precision in error detection and correction, processing over one hundred words per
                    second. Additionally, unnecessary combinations of lexicons in the text are separated
                    according to Tamil morphology to achieve a simpler style in Tamil texts.</p>
                
                <h3>Tool For AutoSuggestion</h3>
                <p>For the first time in the history of Tamil computational linguistics and language
                    technology, we have introduced a unique application: Auto-Suggestion. This feature
                    encompasses nearly all the inflected forms of every lexicon found in our dictionary.</p>
                
                <h3>Tool For Hyphenation</h3>
                <p>While numerous automatic hyphenation tools are available for English, there has been
                    no such tool for Tamilâ€”until now. Our team has developed a Tamil hyphenation tool
                    that utilizes both morphological and syllabic division.</p>
                
                <h3>Tamil Keyboard Drivers</h3>
                <p>To accommodate diverse Tamil-speaking communities across various countries, we
                    offer a comprehensive selection of 18 different Tamil keyboard drivers. Additionally, we
                    provide customization options, allowing users to tailor their keyboards to their preferences.</p>
                
                <h3>Encoding Converter (Non-Unicode to Unicode)</h3>
                <p>MenTamizh now adopts the Tamil Unicode (UTF-8) standard to assist users in
                    converting their old non-Unicode ASCII texts, including both plain and RTF files,
                    into Unicode. Our software includes a font converter supporting over ten legacy fonts,
                    compatible with any file format. Additionally, it offers rapid conversion for individual
                    files and entire folders, completing the process within minutes.</p>
                
                <h4>Easy Transliteration from Tamil Text to Roman Script</h4>
                <p>Our software simplifies the process of transliterating Tamil text into Roman
                    script. It supports both Roman and phonetic transcription, making the conversion
                    seamless and efficient.</p>
                
                <h3>Corpus Creation and Analysis</h3>
                <p>Our advanced language tools facilitate the creation and analysis of Tamil
                    corpus. Effortlessly perform cleaning, normalization, tokenization, type selection, and
                    lexicon extraction for Tamil. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive suite of
                    language analysis tools, including morphological parsing, parts of speech (POS)
                    tagging, N-gram analysis, concordance, and colligation. From phonological analysis
                    to discourse analysis, our software is designed to handle all aspects of written Tamil
                    text analysis with precision and ease.</p>
                
                <h3>E-Dictionary</h3>
                <p>We are dedicated to producing a wide range of dictionaries for Tamil to
                    English and vice versa, leveraging the latest advancements in modern lexicography.
                    Our E-Dictionary projects include a Tamil suspicious words dictionary, synonym and
                    antonym dictionaries, and a dictionary for non-native to native words.</p>
